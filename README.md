TODO

Important:
 - This is a proof of concept. Do not use it on a public server or in production.
 - There is no support for authentication.

Roadmap:
 - Documentation
 - Server stats HTML endpoints (SSE endpoint, HTML endpoint, REST endpoint)
 - Authentication and access control for publish and subscribers
 - Add proper CORS support
 - Multiple endpoints with their own CORS settings
 - Create a docker image
 - etc.
